📘 KNN Classifier on Iris Dataset
This project uses K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to classify flowers in the Iris dataset. It also includes a 2D visualization using PCA and decision boundaries.

✅ What I Did
Loaded the IRIS.csv dataset

Normalized features with StandardScaler

Encoded labels using LabelEncoder

Used PCA to reduce dimensions for visualization

Trained KNN model using scikit-learn

Plotted decision boundaries

Checked accuracy and confusion matrix

📊 Results
Best K: 3

Accuracy: ~96%

Decision boundary plot clearly separates the classes 🌸🌼🌺

🛠 Tools Used
Python

pandas, numpy

scikit-learn

matplotlib
